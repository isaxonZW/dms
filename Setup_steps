Installation and Setup
This project uses a standard Python virtual environment (.venv).

Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher

Google Earth Engine (EE) account and permissions.

Bash

earthengine authenticate
Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Activate the Virtual Environment: Ensure your virtual environment is active.

Bash

# For Windows Command Prompt or Linux/macOS Shell
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install Dependencies: Install all required packages into the active environment using pip. (If you have a requirements.txt file, use that instead.)

Bash

pip install fastapi uvicorn solara pandas geopandas shapely pyproj fpdf requests geemap ipyleaflet matplotlib
Running the Application
The application is started by launching the Uvicorn server, pointing to the integrated Solara/FastAPI application object (fast_app) in main.py.

Start the Server
From the project root directory, run:

Bash

uvicorn main:fast_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Access the Dashboard
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address:

http://localhost:8000
